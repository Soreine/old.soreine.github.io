  This page, for now empty, will showcase experiments of
  generative art (and why not some handmade pixel arts
  someday)&hellip; The small animation you can see above
  was made with <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>,
  a software sketchbook for visual arts and animation,
  whose simplicity allows for fast prototyping and fun.
